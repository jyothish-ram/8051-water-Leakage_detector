# 8051-water-Leakage_detector


This 8051 microcontroller based project used to detect water leakage in pipes using water fow sensor(yf-s201)
NB:This project is an less feathured version of esp32 project from my repo(for more info https://github.com/jyothishram/water_leakage_detector_and_control_system )



This repo contains
  -circuit diagram
  -assembly language code
  -keil files
  -proteus project files
  -simulation video
  
  
 requirements:
    -8051 microcontroller(89c51 is used in this project)
    -water flow sensor(yf-s201)
    -16x2 LCD
    -buzzzer
    -LED
    
 This is an mini project used to find leakages in pipes by using water flow sensor
 this compares consumption at both end of pipes with the sensor and if theres any leak then consumption at both ends wont be equal
 at that time we gets to know theres a leak
 further working is explained in the code**
